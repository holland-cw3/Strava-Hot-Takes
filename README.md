# Strava-Hot-Takes-v2
Makes use of the Strava API in order to update my activity descriptions with random hot takes. The code is hosted on pythonanywhere, and uses tasks to auto update at specific intervals.

The 1.7 update makes use of a JSON file reader/writer in order to delete a "Hot Take" upon it's usage in a post. In doing so, cleaning up the code in the main file "HotTakes.py"
