Any fruity ice cream is just sorbet. Cranberry juice isn't that good, it's just bitter. Gatorade makes for good Smoothies. Bags of chips are just 90% air. Marvel movies aren't that good anymore. Pizza is better upside down. Ben's Take: Marathoning isn't hard. Lillian's Take: Peanut butter bad. Air hockey is weirdly difficult. Lunchables used to be amazing. Ok but fr fr, Harvard John's Mac and Fish is amazing. Taco John's releasing the trademark on Taco Tuesdays is insane. Boneless Chicken Wings are just chicken nuggets. Harvard John's Take: - Putting ice in milk is the move. I don't quite understand the pizzas with no pizza sauce. Vainavi's Take: Food is important for survival. Superman is too overpowered of a superhero, they literally add new powers every year. Melted butter on top of frosted cinnamon rolls = yummy. Don't listen to Spot Holes 2 (the spot theme from across the spideverse) on a 4am run. Most of today's animated movies don't hold up to the classics, such as cars (should've won the bracket). Strawberries are improperly named. Did you know that cashews come from a fruit? I always get tom and jerry mixed up. Was supercalifragilisticexpialadocius a word before Mary Poppins? This one comes from Tim: urban roads are kind of wacky. Brian's Programming Jokes in Joke.py are very funny. McDonald's happy meal toys used to be so much better. Golf is a mid sport, I wish there was pro mini golf. LinkedIn is the new instagram(connect with me pls). Ben's take: Running a mile in over an hour is impossible. C Holland: Challenge Accepted. Jessies's Take: Bark bark bark, bark baaark. Vainavi's Take: Iced drinks shouldn't have ice. Avocado toast is kind of an odd thing.  Vainavi's Take: Cheesecake isn't good. Ok but why doesn't coffee cake have coffee in it? Vainavi's Take: Milk before cereal ALWAYS. Star Wars prequels are underrated. Gingerbread houses are not structurally feasible to live in. Potato chips are mid, potato chips with ripples however are S-tier. Vainavi's Take: Chipotle is overrated. The best part of a muffin is the crispy top. Sprinkles are useless. Vainavi's Take: Frosting is useless. Smooth peanut butter is far superior to crunchy peanut butter.";
